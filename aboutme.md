### My story
I was born in Neuquen, Argentina. A beautiful place plenty of rivers and mountains. I was raised there until I was 18, when I moved to La Plata, Buenos Aires where I got a Master in Physics. While studying, my interest for data science, programming and modeling started to grow, and became a fundamental part of my career and like. My first project consisted in optimizing the public transport grid in La Plata, a project were me and some other interested students worked together with people from the city goverment. This project ended with few and bad results, but I always remember it as a very fun and enjoyable project, that marked the beginning of my career as a Data scientist.

By the age of 22, while not having any problems with traveling far away from my home to start new projects, I had never leave Argentina to visit other countries. This changed when I won a Fulbright Scholarship where I got the oportunitty to study for a few months in USA university. This was a mind blowing experience, the incredible cultural difference made more open to other ways of thinking, it made me more tolerant and humble, but also proud of Argentina, as I started to notice the good things about my country like education and healthcare, things that many time we don't pay attention to and are a privilege in the world. After that experience I became and eager to visit other countries to know more about the world. Something I followed later when I accepted a PhD offer in China.

Roughly 2 years before my graduation I became interested in economy, finances and investments. I created my first webscrapper using python to help me to do investments and gathering data. This is a script I use today and is probably the script I am most proud of.

Later, I started a PhD in Neuroscience in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in an ambitious oportunitty that I didn't doubt to say yes. I have been there for a 2 months. This was another incredible experience , where the cultural difference was even bigger. There I started to work in creating the database that the starting laboratory needed, this included mainly webscrapping and some basic models of Natural Language Proccesing. Then I moved to UK to continue my training and to do data analysis with the main research team, some days after, China started a quarantine due SARS-Covid. There I learned about many machine learning algorithms used for clustering and separation of neural activity, and started to work in projects for improvements of the main sorting spike algoritm that the main team uses. After 3 months I moved back to Argentina to finish my training, just in time since UK started their own quarantine.

Since the start of the quarantine I continued working with data gathered prior to the pandemic and giving online lectures of computational neuroscience, as my knowledge in programming and modeling is something highly regarded in this field.

These days I want to apply my knowledege in a company or bussiness. I want to do data science in real world problems. This is something I always wanted to do, and I know I will be doing after my PhD, but I have the time and opportunity to do it now since is not probable I will be able to go back to China until 2022.
