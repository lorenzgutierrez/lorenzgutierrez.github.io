### My story
I was born in Neuquen, Argentina. A beautiful place with many rivers and mountains. I lived there until I was 18 when I moved to La Plata, Buenos Aires where I got a Master in Physics. 

Later, I started a PhD in Neuroscience in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have been there for a few months and then I moved to UK to continue my training and to do some data analysis with the main research team, some days after China started a quarantine due SARS-Covid. After 3 months I moved back to Argentina to finish my training, just in time since UK started their own quarantine. So now I am here, waiting to hopefully in 2030 be able to be in China again.
