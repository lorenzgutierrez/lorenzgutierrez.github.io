My name is Lorenzo Gutierrez. My main charactheristics are:

- I like calisthenics
- I like data
- I am vegetarian 
- Usually everthing I need fits in a single bag


### My story
I was born in Neuquen, Argentina. A beautiful place with many rivers and mountains. I lived there until I was 18 when I moved to La Plata, Buenos Aires where I got a Master in Physics. During my master, my interest for data science, programming and modeling started to grow, and became a fundamental part of my career. My first project was an optimizator of the public transport in La Plata, a project were me and some other interested students worked together with people from the city goverment. This project ended with the worst results posibles, but I always remember it as a very fun and enjoyable project, that marked the beginning of my career as a Data scientist.

While not having any problems with traveling far away from my home to start new projects, I had never leave Argentina to visit other countries. This changed when I won a Fulbright Scholarship where I got the oportunity to travel to USA. This was a mind blowing experience, the incredible cultural difference made more open to other ways of thinking, it made me more tolerant and humble, but also proud of Argentina, as I started to notice the good things about my country like education and healthcare, things that many time we don't pay attention to and are a privilege in the world. After that experience I became and eager to visit other countries to know more about the world. Something I followed later when I accepted a PhD offer in China.

Roughly 2 years after my graduation I became interested in economy, finances and investments. I created my first webscrapper using python to help me to do investments and gathering data. This is a script I use today and is probably the script I am most proud of.

Later, I started a PhD in Neuroscience in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in an ambitious oportunity that I didn't doubt to accept. I have been there for a few months, and again another mind blowing experience, where the cultural difference was even bigger. There I started to work in creating the database that the laboratory we were opening needed, this included mainly webscrapping and some basic models of Natural Language Proccesing. Then I moved to UK to continue my training and to do some data analysis with the main research team, some days after, China started a quarantine due SARS-Covid. There I learned about many machine learning algorithms used for clustering and separation of neural activity, and started to work in projects for improvements of the main sorting spike algoritm that the main team uses. After 3 months I moved back to Argentina to finish my training, just in time since UK started their own quarantine.

Since the start of the quarantine I continued working with data gathered prior to the pandemic and giving online lectures of computational neuroscience, as my knowledge in programming and modeling is something highly regarded in this field.

These days I want to apply my knowledege in a company or bussiness. I want to do data science in real world problems. This is something I always wanted to do, and was hoping to do it after my PhD, but I have the time and opportunity to do it now since is not probable I will be able to go back to China until 2022.
