This was perhaps the first proper simulation I did. Me and other students implemented a well known and simple statistical model using Montecarlo, considering diferent interactions and taking into account the effect of the temperature in its behaviour. This model consists in N particles with 2 energy levels. The case with no interaction has analytical solution, while the simulation propiced a good view to study the case with complex interactions between particles.

This work was presented in the Anual Argentinian meeting of Physics. The poster is shown below and shows in proper detail what has been done.

## To Do
I consider this project to be finished.
