This was perhaps the first proper simulation I and other students completed during our physics studies. Together we implemented a well-known statistical model using Monte Carlo methods, considering different particle interactions and analyzing how temperature affects the system's behavior.

## The Model

The system consists of N particles, each with 2 or more energy levels. While the case with no interaction between particles has an analytical solution, the simulation provided an excellent starting point to study more complex scenarios where particles interact with each other.

## Results & Presentation

This work was presented at the Annual Argentinian Physics Meeting. The poster below shows in detail the methodology, results, and conclusions of our simulation.
