I was interested in investing in calls and puts, but I was not sure which was the amount of money I should be offering for them. That is how I came with the [Black Scholes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model). I made a script that basically connects with a broker API and gets information about calls and puts, the current price of the stock market, and volatility. Later, it stores all the info and perform the calculations using the Black Scholes formula. Finally it displays which calls (puts) are being sold for less than the BS formula.

**This was the first time I did webscrapping**

## Here is a secondary

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?



It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
